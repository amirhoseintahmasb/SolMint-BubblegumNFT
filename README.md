# SolMint-BubblegumNFT
This project involves the development of a smart contract (Solana Program) using the Metaplex Bubblegum standard to mint NFTs as part of a collection. The contract is written in Rust and incorporates a TypeScript codebase for transaction handling, ensuring robust transaction execution despite potential delays or failures in blockchain or RPC.
